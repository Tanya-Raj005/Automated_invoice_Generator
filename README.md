# Automated_invoice_Generator
The Automated Invoice Generator is a web-based system with secure login, client details entry, and dynamic itemized billing. It auto-calculates totals with tax, stores invoices in local storage (simulating a backend), maintains invoice history, and generates professional PDF invoices using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
